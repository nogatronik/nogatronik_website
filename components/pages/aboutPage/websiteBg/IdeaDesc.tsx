      <h2 className="text-center">The Idea Behind Nogatronik Engineering</h2>
      <p>
        Nogatronik Engineering is a project created by Carlos Nogales, an
        engineer in electronic design and automation, with the aim of
        disseminating science and technology in an accessible and entertaining
        way. This virtual space focuses on areas such as electronics,
        automation, aeromodeling, physics, mathematics, astronomy and
        cutting-edge technology, offering content ranging from the basics to the
        advanced. The project includes educational episodes, electronic product
        evaluations, interviews with experts, practical projects and even a
        podcast.
        <br />
        <br />
        In addition, experiences of failed projects will be shared, highlighting
        the value of learning and resilience in the world of engineering.
        Inspired by his father, Marco Antonio Nogales, who introduced him to the
        world of electronics and technology, Carlos seeks to foster innovation
        and critical thinking, connecting amateurs, professionals and curious
        people in a community that shares knowledge and passion for science.
        With a multidisciplinary approach, Nogatronik Engineering not only
        explores technical topics, but also addresses technological advances
        such as space exploration, artificial intelligence and 3D printing,
        demonstrating how technology is transforming the world.
        <br />
        <br />
        The project&apos;s motto is clear: &ldquo;Empowering ideas, connecting
        minds&rdquo;, reflecting its commitment to the dissemination of
        knowledge and the construction of an innovative future. Welcome to
        Nogatronik Engineering, where science, technology and innovation meet to
        inspire the future!
